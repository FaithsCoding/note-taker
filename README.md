# Note Taker

## Description

For our week 11 challenge we were tasked with using starter code to create an app that can be used to create and store notes. The notes require the user to input a note title and content before a save button appears. This saves their notes and allows them to reappear when the user navigates away from the page. You can also click between notes so you can view your previous inputs.

## Installation

Node Express, VS Code, GitBash

## Usage

To use this application you will need to go to the repository and clone this to your local system. You will then need to open this with VS code and run the command 'npm i' which will install all dependencies needed to allow the project function. Once you have done this you will need to open this in your browser, you will then be shown a landing page with a 'get started' button. Clicking this button navigates you to a notes page. You can then press the '+' button which presents you will empty fields which have placeholder text in. You will need to provide both a title and content, you will then see a save button appear which looks like a floppy disk. You can use this to save your note which will then appear in the left hand column. You can see your notes by clicking them and them appearing in the right hand column.

## Tests

You can test this application by running npm test. You can test the functionality of this app by checking that your notes save, by navigating away from the page for example reloading the page and ensuring your notes remain. You can click through each note you have written and ensure they appear in the correct columns.
